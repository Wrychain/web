Confusion over the nomenclature is leading me to update it to something more familiar.

# New Taxonomy

Station > Category > Channel > Message

A station contains a collection of users and a collection of channels. Sometimes the channels are categorized, sometimes not. Sometimes the creator provides categorization, sometimes the  user does.
Default is no categorization.

A channel can be topic based (in the case of being assigned a station hash tag), but there is not a requirement to be.

Channels can be considered standalone of stations. They can be thought of as a group chat that can be added to a station.

Messages can reply to more than one message.

# Views:

Station
- All channels view
- Station categorization view
- User categorization view

Channel
- Chronological view
- Thead view

Clicking on a message changes chronological view to thread view where the clicked message is the root message
